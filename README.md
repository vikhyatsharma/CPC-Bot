# CPC-Bot
Created a bot that automatically scrapes upcoming programming contests from online coding platforms and post new ones on Competitive Programming Club Discord channel.

It uses Python libraries (such as Selenium, Discord.py and Beautiful Soup) to scrape the web and to
generate an automated message.
